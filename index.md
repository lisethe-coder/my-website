title: Who am I?
---
<br/>
My name is Lisethe Sanmartin, born and raised in Ecuador. Now I am living in the Uk. Graduated at Kingâ€™s College London University, with a degree in Computer Science. 

<br/>
Having just completed my degree course my goal now is to be part of a place where I can perform to my best potential efficiently, with my dedication and expertise. This will allow me to continue my professional and personal growth. For me every day there is something new to learn, considering in the IT industry there is constantly something new being developed. 

<br/>
I am very passionate about photography, learning new programming languages and also I love travelling around the world to meet various people and make new friends.
